# Merit Subnet - ROADMAP

---

## Believe

This roadmap outlines the future vision and milestones for the development and enhancement of the **Merit Subnet** throughout 2025.  
The goal is to continuously improve miner visibility, cross-subnet performance analytics, and reward fairness â€” while scaling the subnet to serve as a robust reputation layer for the broader Bittensor ecosystem.

## Phase 1: Immediate Goals (Q2 2025)

### âœ… Miner Dashboard

- Develop a **public Merit Dashboard** to monitor registered miners:
  - Cross-subnet participation visualization.
  - Historical and live incentive tracking.
  - Uptime and ping reliability graphs.

### âœ… Dashboard Features

- Hotkey registration stats.
- Cross-netuid presence charts.
- Epoch-by-epoch performance comparison.

> ðŸŽ¯ Target: MVP dashboard operational by end of Q2 2025.

## Phase 2: Subnet Analysis Expansion (Q3 2025)

### âœ… Subnet Complexity Scaling and Ranking

- **Hardware Profiling**:
  - Annotate subnets based on average CPU/GPU hardware demands.

- **Popularity Rankings**:
  - Based on total emissions.
  - Total registration volume.
  - Miner churn/attrition rates.

- **Community Engagement Scores**:
  - Optional subsystem to allow miners to vote on subnet friendliness/support.

### âœ… Merit Miner Enhancements

- Allow miners to see which subnets are "easy", "moderate", "difficult" to join.
- Guide miners to high-opportunity subnets.

> ðŸŽ¯ Target: Subnet profiling integrated into Merit dashboard by Q3-Q4 2025.

## Phase 3: Future Feature Development (Q4 2025+)

### âš¡ Other Features (TBD)

- **Multi-subnet Bonus Weighting**:
  - Enhanced emissions for miners active in multiple high-complexity subnets.

---

## Vision Statement

By end of 2025, the Merit Subnet will not only serve as a participation rewards system â€”  
but evolve into a **trusted, decentralized reputation layer** for the entire Bittensor ecosystem.  
Miners will use Merit to strategically grow, validators will enforce fairness, and communities will be able to transparently measure participation across the decentralized AI network.
